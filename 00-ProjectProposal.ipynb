    "Did the characteristics of passengers on the Titanic, such as ticket class, age, and gender, affect an individual's survivability?\n",

    "The RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner infamous for its sinking after colliding with an iceberg on April 15, 1912, resulting in ~1500 people out of the 2200+ passengers dying from the wreck. The data set we are analyzing includes information on 891 passengers, including their passenger class, age, sex, and their accompaniment\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar studies\n",
    "\n",
    "A study similar to our proposed topic, but with a slightly different data set, concluded that gender was, in fact, the key determining factor in survivability.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Because this is a historical topic, we can safely assume that there will be no issues with outdated data or analysis, but the data sets being analyzed may have varying results. Despite being the same size, with 891 passengers, the data set we are analyzing has some additional information that may reveal more nuance in the death statistics. Additionally, the individuals may be different, meaning a different population of the Titanic survivors was sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article from the NIH states that, despite the widespread belief of prioritizing women and children in maritime accidents, women in fact have a significant survival disadvantage in these situations <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). It further asserts that despite the survival rate of women on the Titanic being significantly higher, in the grander scheme of maritime accidents reflects the opposite.\n",

    "1. The dataset we found is actually quite ideal for answering our chosen question.\n",
    "- Contains age, sex, and ticket price/class for each passenger\n",
    "- All passenger data is included, which provides a fuller picture and less bias.\n",
    "- Ideally the data is sourced from the original documents like a passenger list or from ticket sales.\n",
    "- These were probably stored in a spreadsheet-like paper record at the time, then transferred to a digital spreadsheet later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are a few useful real datasets we could use, but most are quite similar to the base one we decided on\n",
    "- [Safe-DS Titanic dataset](https://datasets.safeds.com/en/stable/datasets/titanic/) - contains cabin number which could be used to identify more precise location on the ship.\n",
    "- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_of_the_Titanic) - Contains information about the nationalities of the passengers. This would be useful in examining which nationalities were more likely to survive and if any discriminatory practices in the evacuation of the ship. There is also data on which survivors were on which lifeboats, though that is not particularly useful."

No single person should have to write all the code ot text; each person is responsible for contributing. However, we may utilize Google Docs to write our work and have one person push it to GitHub.\n",
