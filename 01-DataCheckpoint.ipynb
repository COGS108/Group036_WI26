    "The RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner infamous for its sinking after colliding with an iceberg on April 15, 1912, resulting in ~1500 people out of the 2200+ passengers dying from the wreck. The data set we are analyzing includes information on 891 passengers, including their passenger class, age, sex, and their accompaniment. Even though considered a catastrophic event, which are usually described as random or indiscriminate, research consistently shows that social factors shape survival outcomes. Disaster research reveals that survival is influenced by social factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES), age, and gender, rather than pure chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper from Bowdoin College highlights that the Titanic, like many disasters, had \"differential effects\" in which survival and suffering were unequally distributed across class, age, and gender lines. It emphasized that first-class passengers had a survival rate of about 62%, compared to 41% in second class and only 25% in third class (Bowdoin), showcasing stark SES differences and translation to better survival hood. The aper theorizes that the higher status translates into better access to information, lifeboats, and life-saving opportunities.  The paper also incorporates a diagram of the Titanic, showcasing that third class passengers were located lower and at the ends of the boat, second class lower middle, and first class upper middle. This diagram allows for the inference that if the boat were sinking, the first-class passengers had more time to reach life-saving measures. The same piece showcases that women and children had much higher rates of survival, with 75 and 50 percent, respectively, while men only had about 20% survival. This follows suit with the order Captain E.J. Smith gave to officers, \"women and children first.\" The paper also mentions that certain officers interpreted these orders differently, with Officer Lightroller taking the order to mean women and children only, lowering lifeboats even before full capacity to prioritize women and children's survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more formal analysis, Frey, Heggli, and Osterloh used individual-level Titanic data to test how economic resources, age, and gender affected the probability of survival. Aside from reconfirming that class and gender played a large role in the probability of survival, they showed age mattered as well. People in their \"prime\" (ages around 15-35) were more likely to survive than older passengers (Frey et al.), suggesting that physical mobility and stamina interacted with the other categories to shape outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study similar to our proposed topic, but with a slightly different data set, concluded that gender was, in fact, the key determining factor in survivability.1 Because this is a historical topic, we can safely assume that there will be no issues with outdated data or analysis, but the data sets being analyzed may have varying results. Despite being the same size, with 891 passengers, the data set we are analyzing has some additional information that may reveal more nuance in the death statistics. Additionally, the individuals may be different, meaning a different population of the Titanic survivors was sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article from the NIH states that, despite the widespread belief of prioritizing women and children in maritime accidents, women in fact have a significant survival disadvantage in these situations 2. It further asserts that despite the survival rate of women on the Titanic being significantly higher, in the grander scheme of maritime accidents reflects the opposite.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shraddha4ever20/titanic-datset \n",
    "\n",
    "Number of observations: 891\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of variables: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of the variables most relevant to this project: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project: This dataset has some null values for the passenger ages. It also contains some repeated data in different formats (e.g., passenger class in both numeric and string formats). While this is not inherently a downside, it forces us to decide which format works better for our analysis purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary dataset we selected from Kaggle is well-suited for our research question since it includes individual-level information on survival, age, sex, ticket class, and fare for 891 passengers. This allows us to look at how socioeconomic status (class and fare), age, and gender all influenced survival outcomes. Although this dataset represents a portion rather than the full passenger and crew list, it is large enough to support meaningful statistical analysis while remaining manageable for our project. Each row in the kaggle dataset corresponds to a single passenger and includes variables such as survival status (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived), passenger class (which we treate as a SES indicator), sex (nale/female), age, fare (ticket price, another SES indicator), and a few additional identifiers which wont be used but could be linked to external sources for deeper context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal scenario, we would work with a complete manifest that includes all passengers and crew, precise cabin locations, lifeboat assignments, and verified socioeconomic status indicators directly sourced from the original passenger documents. That dataset would have helped to reduce sampling bias and enable more detailed modeling of how physical location on the ship and social status affected the changes of reaching a lifeboat. Our current Kaggle dataset approximates this ideal by providing demographic and class variables, but is limited by missing ages and the absence of detailed location or income information.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few complementary real-world datasets and sources that could help us move closer to this scenario. For example, the Safe-DS Titanic dataset includes cabin numbers, which would allow us to incorporate more precise spatial information about where passengers were located on the ship at the time of impact. Wikipedia's compiled passenger list and summaries provide additional attributes that can help us, such as nationality and, in some cases, lifeboat assignment. Nationality can be used to explore potential discrimination or differences in survival by country of origin, while lifeboat assignments can help reconstruct evacuation patterns. Together, these sources could be integrated with the Kaggle dataset to create a more complete picture, but our core analysis for how class, age, and gender influenced survival, which the Kaggle dataset already holds the essential variables we need.\n",

    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables we are using are pclass, sex, age, fare, who, adult_male, and alive. Pclass refers to passenger class, ranging from 1 to 3 for first, second, and third class, and can be interpreted as a proxy for passenger socio-economic class. Sex indicates male or female. Age is represented in years, with some half years and infant ages represented in decimal values. Fare shows each passenger’s ticket price in dollars. Who indicates if the passenger is a man, a woman, or a child. Adult male is a separate variable for whether the passenger was a man, represented by true or false. Alive indicates whether the passenger survived with true or false. \n",
    "\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
