    "The RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner infamous for its sinking after colliding with an iceberg on April 15, 1912, resulting in ~1500 people out of the 2200+ passengers dying from the wreck. The data set we are analyzing includes information on 891 passengers, including their passenger class, age, sex, and their accompaniment. Even though considered a catastrophic event, which are usually described as random or indiscriminate, research consistently shows that social factors shape survival outcomes. Disaster research reveals that survival is influenced by social factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES), age, and gender, rather than pure chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper from Bowdoin College highlights that the Titanic, like many disasters, had \"differential effects\" in which survival and suffering were unequally distributed across class, age, and gender lines. It emphasized that first-class passengers had a survival rate of about 62%, compared to 41% in second class and only 25% in third class (Bowdoin), showcasing stark SES differences and translation to better survival hood. The aper theorizes that the higher status translates into better access to information, lifeboats, and life-saving opportunities.  The paper also incorporates a diagram of the Titanic, showcasing that third class passengers were located lower and at the ends of the boat, second class lower middle, and first class upper middle. This diagram allows for the inference that if the boat were sinking, the first-class passengers had more time to reach life-saving measures. The same piece showcases that women and children had much higher rates of survival, with 75 and 50 percent, respectively, while men only had about 20% survival. This follows suit with the order Captain E.J. Smith gave to officers, \"women and children first.\" The paper also mentions that certain officers interpreted these orders differently, with Officer Lightroller taking the order to mean women and children only, lowering lifeboats even before full capacity to prioritize women and children's survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more formal analysis, Frey, Heggli, and Osterloh used individual-level Titanic data to test how economic resources, age, and gender affected the probability of survival. Aside from reconfirming that class and gender played a large role in the probability of survival, they showed age mattered as well. People in their \"prime\" (ages around 15-35) were more likely to survive than older passengers (Frey et al.), suggesting that physical mobility and stamina interacted with the other categories to shape outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study similar to our proposed topic, but with a slightly different data set, concluded that gender was, in fact, the key determining factor in survivability.1 Because this is a historical topic, we can safely assume that there will be no issues with outdated data or analysis, but the data sets being analyzed may have varying results. Despite being the same size, with 891 passengers, the data set we are analyzing has some additional information that may reveal more nuance in the death statistics. Additionally, the individuals may be different, meaning a different population of the Titanic survivors was sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article from the NIH states that, despite the widespread belief of prioritizing women and children in maritime accidents, women in fact have a significant survival disadvantage in these situations 2. It further asserts that despite the survival rate of women on the Titanic being significantly higher, in the grander scheme of maritime accidents reflects the opposite.\n",

    "After deliberation, we predict that Gender and Class will have had the most effect on any individual on the Titanic’s survival, and consequently the associated significance statistics and weight on any model will be largest. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the gender characteristic, we believe that the use of “Women and Children first” or the WCF order, during the Titanic’s sinking had a major positive impact on the survival rates of Females and Passengers that would fit the “Children” characteristic. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the socioeconomic aspect, we believe that the type of ticket, reflecting the class of the individual who purchased the ticket, will have a positive correlation with their associated survival rate. This, we agreed on, will be due to a number of factors, primarily a prevailing classism present during the time period, as well as a number of physical characteristics such as the location of second and third class passengers being lower on the Titanic compared to first class passengers.\n"

    "### Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary dataset we selected from Kaggle is well-suited for our research question since it includes individual-level information on survival, age, sex, ticket class, and fare for 891 passengers. This allows us to look at how socioeconomic status (class and fare), age, and gender all influenced survival outcomes. Although this dataset represents a portion rather than the full passenger and crew list, it is large enough to support meaningful statistical analysis while remaining manageable for our project. Each row in the kaggle dataset corresponds to a single passenger and includes variables such as survival status (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived), passenger class (which we treate as a SES indicator), sex (nale/female), age, fare (ticket price, another SES indicator), and a few additional identifiers which wont be used but could be linked to external sources for deeper context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal scenario, we would work with a complete manifest that includes all passengers and crew, precise cabin locations, lifeboat assignments, and verified socioeconomic status indicators directly sourced from the original passenger documents. That dataset would have helped to reduce sampling bias and enable more detailed modeling of how physical location on the ship and social status affected the changes of reaching a lifeboat. Our current Kaggle dataset approximates this ideal by providing demographic and class variables, but is limited by missing ages and the absence of detailed location or income information.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few complementary real-world datasets and sources that could help us move closer to this scenario. For example, the Safe-DS Titanic dataset includes cabin numbers, which would allow us to incorporate more precise spatial information about where passengers were located on the ship at the time of impact. Wikipedia's compiled passenger list and summaries provide additional attributes that can help us, such as nationality and, in some cases, lifeboat assignment. Nationality can be used to explore potential discrimination or differences in survival by country of origin, while lifeboat assignments can help reconstruct evacuation patterns. Together, these sources could be integrated with the Kaggle dataset to create a more complete picture, but our core analysis for how class, age, and gender influenced survival, which the Kaggle dataset already holds the essential variables we need.\n",

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

We will also reserve conclusions to within reason, i.e. any conclusion that \"women and children were more likely to survive\" will be carefully ftamed with its context (WCS policy called, not enough lifeboats) and the acknowledgement that both regulation and policy on cruise ships have changed since 1912.\n",
